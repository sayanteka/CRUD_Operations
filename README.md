If I keep on clicking up button, it reruns and the concept of counter doesn't work. It just prints 0 and 1.
So we have to store that in session state i.e. outside rerun block. So counter var will be a key in session state

Suppose airbnb app has 3 components auth, payment, listings. problem with monolithic, if i change anything in authentication i need to redeploy again all units. Thus I have scaling issue. can't scale up indiviadual component. has to scale up every components. If I have developed any of the components with java then it has to be java for other components as well. advantage: Easier to develop and manage.

Benefit of micro: Independent Deployment. Scaling up Benefit.
